# image-resizer
This is a simple image resizing project I've made for studying. It was built using Node.js and mainly the Sharp module. The usage is very simple, you just need to put the image file inside the program folder and then run the command below in a command line interface:

> node app (FILE_NAME) (NEW_WIDTH)

It's good to mention that the resizer will always keep the aspect ratio of the original image, without stretching or cropping it.
